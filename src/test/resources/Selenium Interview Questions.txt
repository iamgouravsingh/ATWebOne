Selenium Interview Questions:

Interviewer: Let's start with the framework you've worked on. Could you tell me about it?

You: Certainly. I've primarily worked on a modular-driven automation framework using Java, TestNG, and Selenium WebDriver. The aim was to create a scalable, maintainable, and easily understandable framework for both technical and non-technical team members. 
*You can add more details about the framework.

Interviewer: Interesting. In such frameworks, challenges are inevitable. Can you share a specific challenge you faced and how you overcame it?

You: One notable challenge was dealing with dynamic elements, which frequently changed their attributes. To tackle this, we implemented dynamic waits using WebDriverWait along with ExpectedConditions to wait for elements until they stabilized.

Interviewer: Handling dynamic elements is crucial indeed. Apart from Selenium's built-in methods, how did you handle dynamic variables?

You: Besides relying on Selenium's methods, we incorporated custom logic. This involved using regular expressions, string manipulation, and dynamic XPath/CSS selectors to locate elements based on changing attributes or text.

Interviewer: Moving on to browser tabs, how did you handle multiple tabs in Selenium?

You: For handling multiple tabs, we utilized WebDriver's window handles. By using getWindowHandles() to get handles of all open windows, we could then switch between tabs using the switchTo() method.


Interviewer: Good. Now, which interface or class does getWindowHandles() belong to?

You: getWindowHandles() belongs to the WebDriver interface in Selenium.

Interviewer: Excellent. Let's talk about dealing with multiple products in a web table, like on Amazon. How would you approach selecting one product and adding it to the cart?

You: First, we'd locate the web table containing products using its unique identifier. Then, by iterating through the rows and columns, we'd identify the desired product based on specific criteria such as product name or ID.

Interviewer: Great approach. Lastly, could you explain the exceptions thrown by findElement and findElements methods in Selenium?

You: Certainly. Both findElement and findElements throw a NoSuchElementException when the element being searched for is not found in the DOM.

Interviewer: And what about the StaleElementReferenceException? Can you explain it with an example and how to handle it?

You: A StaleElementReferenceException occurs when the element is no longer attached to the DOM, often due to a page refresh or navigation. For instance, if an element is located and stored, but the page changes, attempting to interact with the stored element will trigger this exception. To overcome it, we typically re-locate the element or refresh the page before interacting with it again.

Interviewer: Thank you for your detailed responses. It was a pleasure discussing your experience with automation testing.


Hello Guys, If you are preparing for Java-Selenium interview then I have listed out few common set of questions which helps to crack the interviews
#SeleniumInterviewPreparation #SeleniumJava #MostRecentSeleniumInterviewQuestions 

1 How do you handle windows and tabs?
'getWindowHandles(), switchTo(), and close() methods. Here's how you can handle windows and tabs:
Set<String> windowHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();


2 How do you handle iframes?
Use the switchTo().frame() method to switch to the iframe by specifying one of the following:
Index: Switch to the iframe by its index (starting from 0).
Name or ID: Switch to the iframe by its name or ID attribute value.
WebElement: Switch to the iframe using a WebElement representing the iframe.

// Switch to the iframe by index
driver.switchTo().frame(0);

// Switch to the iframe by name or ID
driver.switchTo().frame("iframeNameOrId");

// Switch to the iframe by WebElement
WebElement iframeElement = driver.findElement(By.tagName("iframe"));
driver.switchTo().frame(iframeElement);


3 Diff between FindElement and FindElements.

4 Explain Different locators in selenium
ID
Xpath
CSS Selector
name
Class Name
Tag Name
Link Text
Partial Link Text


5 Explain diff waits in Selenium/ diff between implicit and explicit wait.
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("someId")));

6 How do you handle dynamic elements in Selenium WebDriver?
Implicit and Explicit Waits
ExpectedConditions
Dynamic Locators - xpath & css selector
Retry Mechanisms
Stale Element Reference Exception Handling

7 Tell me some exceptions you have faced while writing the framework.
NoSuchElementException
TimeoutException
StaleElementReferenceException
ElementNotInteractableException
ElementNotVisibleException
NoSuchWindowException
NoSuchFrameException
UnhandledAlertException
SessionNotCreatedException
WebDriverException
Handling these exceptions appropriately in your framework can improve its robustness and reliability, ensuring smoother execution of your Selenium tests.
